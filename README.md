This repository presents a **weakly supervised framework** for optic disc (OD) and optic cup (OC) segmentation from retinal fundus images, developed for automated glaucoma screening. 

The approach removes the reliance on pixel-level expert annotations by leveraging **anatomically guided pseudo-labels** generated from unannotated data, making it a scalable solution for large-scale deployment.

## 🎯 Motivation

Accurate glaucoma screening relies on morphological analysis of the optic nerve head, particularly the **Cup-to-Disc Ratio (vCDR)**. However, pixel-level annotations are costly, subjective, and difficult to scale.

This project addresses these limitations by:
* **Pseudo-Label Training:** Training segmentation models entirely on synthesized data.
* **Clinical Priors:** Enforcing anatomical constraints during label generation.
* **Interpretable Outputs:** Producing direct segmentation masks without post-hoc black-box classifiers.

## 🧠 Method Overview

The proposed framework consists of three main components:

### 1. Pseudo-Label Generation
Pseudo-labels for OD and OC are automatically generated using anatomically guided heuristics:
* **Intensity Contrast:** Brightness cues to identify the cup.
* **Circularity Constraints:** Approximating the natural shape of the optic nerve head.
* **Spatial Consistency:** Ensuring the cup is contained within the disc.
* **Ratio Priors:** Using clinically motivated area ratios.



> **Note:** Morphological post-processing is applied to reduce noise and enforce structural plausibility.

### 2. Weakly Supervised Segmentation
Segmentation networks are trained using pseudo-labels as weak supervision:
* **Architecture:** U-Net–based variants with ImageNet-pretrained encoders.
* **Hybrid Loss:** Designed to address class imbalance, boundary uncertainty, and label noise.

### 3. Clinical Metric Extraction
Pixel-level predictions are directly converted into **Vertical Cup-to-Disc Ratio (vCDR)** measurements, enabling end-to-end screening.
